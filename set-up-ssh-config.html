  <h2>Set up SSH config (and proxy)</h2>
  <hr/>
  <a href='./'>Go back</a>
  <p>
    You are here because you'd like to know how to set up your <tt>ssh</tt> config (and proxy).
  </p>
  <p>
    Some reasons to do the first:
    <ul>
      <li>
        You don't want to use your password
      </li>
      <li>
        You want to set up a shorter alias
      </li>
    </ul>
    And the second:
    <ul>
      <li>
        You want to proxy jump to avoid a VPN
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    Here are the steps to go password-less:
    <ul>
      
      <li>
        On your local machine, perform <tt>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</tt> and copy the results to your clipboard.
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <tt>ssh</tt> into your remote host with your usual method. Perform <tt>mkdir -p ~/.ssh</tt> and then append the contents of your clipboard to <tt>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt> using a method of your choice. An easy way to do this is <tt>echo 'content' >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</tt>, replacing <tt>content</tt> as necessary.
      </li>

      <li>
        At this point, you should be able to <tt>ssh</tt> into your remote and it should not ask for a password. Feel free to try it out now. Note that this is different if you are the root user, and requires some extra steps, explained well <a href='https://askubuntu.com/questions/497895/permission-denied-for-rootlocalhost-for-ssh-connection'>here</a>.
      </li>
      
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Next up, here are the steps to add an alias for your config:

    <ul>
      <li>
        On your local machine, open up <tt>~/.ssh/config</tt> with your favorite text editor. For me, this means <tt>emacs ~/.ssh/config</tt>.
      </li>

      <li>
        The simplest configuration looks like this:
        <pre
          >
          Host lnxsrv07
            User arteen
            HostName lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
        </pre>
        <tt>Host</tt> specifies the alias. <tt>User</tt> the user to log-in for. <tt>HostName</tt> is the endpoint. For example, where before you had typed <tt>ssh arteen@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu</tt>, you can now type <tt>ssh lnxsrv07</tt>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, for those of you who'd like to bypass a VPN, I neither condone, admonish, or take any responsibility for this behavior:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Simply add the following line to the previous configuration:
        <pre
          >
            ProxyJump server
        </pre>
        where <tt>server</tt> is a remote host within the network you would like to access that does not require the usage of a VPN.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can now perform <tt>ssh lnxsrv07</tt> from anywhere you like, without VPN or password.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
